 WHAT IS THIS?
===============

This is a library for the Arduino for controlling LCD modules based on the
popular Hitachi HD44780 controller.  The library supports all features of
the controller and can operate in either 4pin or 8pin mode without modifying
any source code.


 WHY, THERE IS ALREADY ANOTHER LIB?
====================================

Well I thought it would be fun to write, and the other libraries where not
really fully featured and or a bit messy.  I also wanted to have a single
library for handing both 4pin and 8pin mode without modifying library files.


 HOW TO INSTALL
================

Make a directory in the arduino libraries directory:
mkdir ~/arduino/hardware/libraries/Lcd

Copy Lcd.h and Lcd.cpp to it:
cp Lcd.h Lcd.cpp ~/arduino/hardware/libraries/Lcd


 HOW TO USE
============

Click Sketch->Import Library->Lcd.  This should include the Lcd.h header
automagically.  You will find some sample sketches that demonstrate how
to use this library in the package you downloaded.


 WIRING
========

By default the Lcd class will setup the LCD module in 8 pin mode with the
following pin assignment:

RS -> 1
RW -> 2
E  -> 3
D0 -> 4
...
D7 -> 11

As of version 0.2, the RW pin is used in order to check the busy flag of
the LCD's internal processor.  This eliminates the hard coded waits after
each command sent to the LCD and should prove to be more portable and
reliable in the long run.
